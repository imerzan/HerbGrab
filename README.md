# HerbGrab
TBC-Classic app to "tap" herbalism (or other) nodes ASAP in contested situations. Ideal for first-tapping Underbog Colossus in SSC.

### Instructions
1. Launch program, minimize window. Open World of Warcraft.
2. When a mob dies that can be herbed/mined/etc., press and HOLD `F1` while hovering your cursor over the dead mob.
3. HerbGrab will rapidly `Right-click` to attempt to get the first-tap before other players, and allow you to herb/mine the mob.
4. After releasing the `F1` key, right-clicking will cease. Enjoy your Mana Thistle ;)
